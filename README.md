# Intelligent knowledge extraction for understanding volume expansion in lithiated battery electrode (Attention Mechanism, NLP)

NER analysis for terms such as : Battery (specific capacity), Volume expansion, Mechanical Stress and Strain. 

A. Intelligent app to study the text of Lithium ion battery mechanics and store them in database format: lithiation_knowledge.db (concise information) and knowledge_universe.db (full knowledge). Web app (to be made available soon...)

B. Learner tool that reads the .db files through the following stepwise processes

(i) inspect the knowledge databases and provide the key summary

(ii) common term analysis in diverse literature 

(iii) NER analysis for the most significant words/phrases summarized from (i)-(ii)
